# Introduction

This API implements methods for creation and management of translation projects with [Bureau Works](https://bureau.works).

## Getting Started

Before you use your API credentials, there are a few items that need to be checked first. Users in Works with a profile suitable 
to request projects are bound to Clients. Clients are organizations or persons, and they allow for multiple users to share the 
same workspace. Your `Client` can be your own company, a corporation you work for, or youself.

We need to make sure that a `Client` has the following information on file:

- Country
- Currency
- Timezone (for properly calculating key dates)

<!---




    AUTH




-->

# Authentication

> Auth example, uses a JSON model in the request body:

```json
{
   "accesskey":"eeecccff-9999-332f-333c-999999999999",
   "secretAccesskey": "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"
}
```

```shell
curl "https://bureau.works/api/pub/v1/login"
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
  -X POST -d '<MODEL>'
```

> Response `200` `X-AUTH-TOKEN: <TOKEN>`

Use this method to get the credentials necessary to access the API endpoints. 

If authentication is successful, returns a header `X-AUTH-TOKEN` that must be used in all subsequent API calls:

`X-AUTH-TOKEN: {token}`

### HTTP Request

`POST https://bureau.works/api/pub/v1/login`

<aside class="notice">
Please note that the API credentials are separated from your Bureau Works login and password. You must get your API credentials under the <b>My Account</b> section.

    LOCALE




-->

# Locale

Methods that provide support data for `Project` requests.

<!---




    LANGS




-->

## Languages

```shell
curl "https://bureau.works/api/pub/v1/language"
  -H "X-AUTH-TOKEN: <TOKEN>"
```

> Response `200` `application/json`

```json
[
  {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "Abkhaz",
      "code": "ab"
  },
  {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Afar",
      "code": "aa"
  },
  {
      "id": 3,
      "name": "Afrikaans",
      "code": "af"
  }
]
```

These are all available languages in Bureau Works. If your project demands a translation in a language that is not
listed by this API, please contact us to resolve the issue.

You must use the value in `code` fields to populate requests with source or target languages.

### HTTP Request

`GET https://bureau.works/api/pub/v1/language`

<!---




    TIMEZONES




-->

## Timezones

```shell
curl "https://bureau.works/api/pub/v1/timezone"
  -H "X-AUTH-TOKEN: <TOKEN>"
```

> Response `200` with a JSON formatted like this:

```json
[
    {
        "key": "AET",
        "value": "(GMT+10:00) AET"
    },
    {
        "key": "Antarctica/DumontDUrville",
        "value": "(GMT+10:00) Antarctica/DumontDUrville"
    },
    {
        "key": "Asia/Ust-Nera",
        "value": "(GMT+10:00) Asia/Ust-Nera"
    },
    {
        "key": "Asia/Vladivostok",
        "value": "(GMT+10:00) Asia/Vladivostok"
    },
    {
        "key": "Australia/ACT",
        "value": "(GMT+10:00) Australia/ACT"
    }
]
```

Timezones are used according to a client's or person's location. When creating a project, you must specify a timezone in order to correctly calculate creation date, and also due and delivery dates.

In your requests, you may use the `key` to populate `timezone` fields.

### HTTP Request

`GET https://bureau.works/api/pub/v1/timezone`

    PROJECT




-->

# Project

Projects are the core of the workflows in Bureau Works. We need to create Projects to engage professionals and users alike, perform translations, reviews or publish deliverables to
our clients. With these APIs, you can create and manage your own projects, as well as check for deliveries, approvals and get cost information. With the Project API, you will be able
to push files for translation, and receive the deliverables programatically.

A `Project` creation must follow this workflow:

- Create a `Project` wireframe, with languages and services - `Project` is created with a `Preparing` status
- Upload files to the desired services - only `Translation` services may be analyzed and counted automatically
- Finish "preparing" your projects, once you finish uploading file,s by invoking the `ready` method - `Project` is transitioned to a `Pending` state
- While `Pending`, you may approve or cancel the `Project` - approving a project will send it to production

## Services

```shell
curl "https://bureau.works/api/pub/v1/service"
  -H "X-AUTH-TOKEN: <TOKEN>"
```

> Response `200` `application/json`

```json
[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Translation"
    },
    {
        "id": 2,
        "name": "Sworn Translation"
    },
    {
        "id": 3,
        "name": "Transcription"
    },
    {
        "id": 4,
        "name": "Subtitling"
    },
    {
        "id": 5,
        "name": "Formatting & Design"
    },
    {
        "id": 6,
        "name": "Voiceover"
    },
    {
        "id": 7,
        "name": "Interpretation"
    },
    {
        "id": 8,
        "name": "Product Testing"
    },
    {
        "id": 9,
        "name": "In-Country Review"
    },
    {
        "id": 10,
        "name": "Project Management"
    },
    {
        "id": 11,
        "name": "File Engineering"
    },
    {
        "id": 12,
        "name": "Video QA"
    }
]
```

This method returns all `Services` available in the API, the most common is `Translation`. You can create projects with one or more 
`Services`, by using the `id` attribute in the requests that require this specification.

### HTTP Request

`GET https://bureau.works/api/pub/v1/service`

<!---




    PROJECT / CREATE




-->

## Create Project

> Request with this `model` in the body of the request, where `sourceLanguage` and `targetLanguages` are codes from the Language API, and `services` are IDs from the Service API. You can provide a `projectType` to communicate the kind of project, for example, `AEM` for Adobe Experience Manager, or `Finance` to offer some background on the content at hand.

```json
{
    "reference" : "Test project 004",
    "sourceLanguage" : "en_us",
    "targetLanguages" : ["pt_br", "es"],
    "services" : [1],
    "notes" : "You can add some notes here",
    "desiredDeliveryDate" : 1500392096126,
    "projectType" : null
}
```

```shell
curl "https://bureau.works/api/pub/v1/project"
  -H "X-AUTH-TOKEN: <TOKEN>"
  -X POST -d '<MODEL>'
```

> Response `200` `application/json`

```json
{
    "id": 10228,
    "clientName": "Bureau Translations",
    "clientId": 120,
    "currency": "USD",
    "name": "B-1865-72739",
    "reference": "Test project AEM3",
    "sourceLanguage": "pt_br",
    "quoteDueDate": 1500390746451,
    "creationDate": 1520385139654,
    "status": "PREPARING",
    "grandTotal": null,
    "delivered": false,
    "targetLanguages": [
        "en_us",
        "es"
    ],
    "tags": [],
    "items": [
        {
            "id": 13769,
            "serviceId": 1,
            "serviceName": "Translation",
            "originalFiles": [],
            "filesDeliveredByManagers": [],
            "deliveries": [],
            "words": 0,
            "subtotal": 0,
            "savings": 0,
            "grandTotal": 0,
            "jobs": []
        }
    ]
}
```

This will create a Project "wireframe", with a `Preparing` state. This means that the newly created project is ready to receive
files associated to all service items selected. You don't need to upload files for all service items, but usually a `Translation`
requires some files. Services that not necessarily require files are Interpreation, Consulting, Project Management, etc.

The DTO (Data Transfer Object) returned by this request is a simple representation of the `Project`. You will need some of this information
in order to proceed. Some key attributes to note here:

- `id` is the unique ID of the newly created `Project`
- `name` is an internal identifier and will be pointed out in Bureau Works, some reports, etc.
- `quoteDueDate` will be the millisecond representation of the desired date you submitted. This date may change depending on the analysis and
word count to be performed afterwards. If a desired date will occur before the calculated due date, the project may incur rush fees.
- `items` is an array with the services you selected. A given item's `id` is also unique accross the system, and you will need this value to
submit files for these services.
- `originalFiles` will contain the files you submit.
- `filesDeliveredByManagers` our project managers can also deliver files, perhaps after review rounds or other services, and here's where they will appear.


### HTTP Request

`POST https://bureau.works/api/pub/v1/project`

<!---




    PROJECT / FILE UPLOAD




-->

## Upload Files to a Project

```shell
curl -i -X POST -v -F "file=@/home/user/Desktop/file.docx"
  "https://bureau.works/api/pub/v1/project/{id}/file/{serviceItemId}"
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data"
  -H "X-AUTH-TOKEN: <TOKEN>"
```

> Response `200` `application/json`

```json
[
    {
        "id": 11,
        "serviceItemId": 13770,
        "sourceLang": "pt_br",
        "targetLang": "en_us",
        "fileName": "BT_JD_Template_.docx",
        "status": "NEW",
        "statusChangeTimestamp": 1520572747693
    },
    {
        "id": 12,
        "serviceItemId": 13770,
        "sourceLang": "pt_br",
        "targetLang": "es",
        "fileName": "BT_JD_Template_.docx",
        "status": "NEW",
        "statusChangeTimestamp": 1520572747693
    }
]
```

This method returns an `HTTP 200` response if the upload is successful. The response body contains information about the job, such as its ID and status. This method is synchronous, so depending on the file size, a typical upload can take 
a few seconds to a couple of minutes for larger files, like a 50MB Text Document. During the upload process, a job may be created in the cat tool, which further
delays a response.

Each request will upload one file. If you upload the same file more than one time, it will be overwritten.

You must upload all your files to finish the preparation of the project for quoting.

### HTTP Request

### Query Parameters

Parameter | Required | Description
--------- | ------- | -----------

When you're done uploading your files, invoke this method to signal to Bureau Works that your `Project` is ready for quoting. This will trigger an analysis
tool that will try to parse and analyze the data. If the files are suitable for analysis, this method will return the cost structure. Otherwise, the quote will
update by our team and you will have that information in the system within a couple of hours if the project is submitted in business hours.

The DTO returned in JSON format contains the cost structure per Service Item and per language. Here are some key attributes:

- `inputWordsCount` this is the total word count for your project.
- `subtotal` is the cost of the project, the gross cost, without leveraging of Translation Memory.
- `savings` represents the value amount of savings due to Translation Memory leveraging.
- `grandTotal` is the the actual value you owe if you approve your project.
- `langPairCosts` is an array with a detailed breakdown of costs per target language, with the Translation Matches included.

If the `Project` is not analyzed automatically, it will return a JSON but with blank values and zeroes. That means that our team will provide a manual update, 
and in a similar structure.

]
```

This method returns all items (service items and jobs) related to the project with `id`. The array `jobs` contains information about individual jobs, i.e.,
per language and unique file within that project and service scope. Possible statuses for `jobs` are: `NEW`, `READY_FOR_TRANSLATION`, `TRANSLATION_IN_PROGRESS`, `TRANSLATION_APPROVED`, `TRANSLATION_REJECTED`, `TRANSLATION_DELIVERED` and `PROJECT_CANCELLED`, where:

`NEW` - file has just been uploaded.

`READY_FOR_TRANSLATION` - project is pending, waiting for approval

`TRANSLATION_IN_PROGRESS` - project was approved, so jobs will transition to this

`TRANSLATION_APPROVED` - user calls the `approve-job` endpoint to mark a job as accepted

`TRANSLATION_REJECTED` - user calls the `reject-job` endpoint and the job is marked as rejected

`TRANSLATION_DELIVERED` - translation is delivered by Bureau Works and corresponding translated file is available in the `deliveries` array

`PROJECT_CANCELLED` - the project has been cancelled for some reason, rendering all jobs as invalid


### HTTP Request
`GET /api/pub/v1/project/{id}/items`

### Query Parameters
